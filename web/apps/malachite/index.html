            This place is a message... and part of a system of messages... <strong>pay attention to it!</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Sending this message was important to us. We considered ourselves to be a powerful culture.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>This place is <em>not</em> a place of honor...</li>
            <li><em>No</em> highly esteemed deed is commemorated here...</li>
            <li><em>Nothing</em> of value is here.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            What is here was <span class="danger">dangerous</span> and repulsive to us. This message is a warning about <span>danger</span>.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <span class="danger">danger</span> is in a particular location...</li>
            <li>it <em>increases</em> towards a center...</li>
            <li>the center of danger is <em>here</em>...</li>
            <li>of a particular size and shape, and <strong>below us</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The <span class="danger">danger</span> is still present, in your time, as it was in ours.</p>
        <p>The <span class="danger">danger</span> is to the body, and it can kill.</p>
        <p>The form of the <span class="danger">danger</span> is an emanation of energy.</p>
        <p>
            The <span class="danger">danger</span> is unleashed only if you substantially disturb this place physically. This place is best shunned and left uninhabited.
